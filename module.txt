module {
fn offs:
    foff0    : {dist f0 text  , 1}
    ...
    foffN
    dynfoff0 : {dist dynf0 sig, 0}
    ...
    dynfoffK
    NULL
symbol offs:
    soff0
    ...
    soffM
    NULL
fn main text (ends with return opcode)
fn text:
    fn0
    ...
    fnN
symbol text:
    symbol0
    ...
    symbolM
}

fn/symbol offs == 1 (impossible to have as smaller module has NULL, NULL) means
patch at load time

main is executed at module load time (or is the real main)


fn off is 64bit,
    { offset, 1b } => offset refers to the distance of a function text
    { offset, 0b } => offset refers to the dinstance of a symbol of a function
    signature

at init {off, 1b} it's replaced by (module address)+off, that is the pointer to
the function text
at dynload {off, 0b} it's replaced by the address of the function, in another
module.
